# Crescendo

The inspiration for this application was to create an environment where music enthusiasts are able to connect with one another and communicate about a shared passion.  Using information from Spotify, we are able to gather metrics that quantify compatibility between users based on music genres, favorite artists, and other criteria.  Essentially, Crescendo is a social network focused entirly on the world of music and how to connect like mided individuals.  
Our application uses fundamental technologies like Javascript, HMTL, and CSS and untilizes various API calls to collect necessary information from Spotify.
